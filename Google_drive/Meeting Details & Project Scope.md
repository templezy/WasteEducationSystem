#Waste Education Application
##Meeting Details
Based on the scope mentioned in the previous document, we discussed about the details of this education application in this meeting. Firstly, we talk about the game part of this system. In order to make the game more attractive, I decide to add more interactions into varies games. For example, we could use the dragging and dropping action to simulate the event, which put the rubbish into the rubbish bin. Further more, we could add some punishment into the game to increase the difficulty. Beside of this, we also discussed the visualisation of the varies data. Phillipa gave me some formulas that could used to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions. We could use these formulas to generate the data and link to the daily activity. This will more impressive. The diagrams and charts is also an other method to express the data generated by the formula. I think we could combined used them.

##Project Scope

###Architecture
I have build a prototype for the web page part. The Figure1 show the architecture of the whole systems. The basement of this system is the infrastructure. Above it is the data level. The data level is the core part of the whole system. Due to the varieties of users, all the devices (PC, iPhone, Android Mobile Phone) could send the data through the network. In order to reduce the network interface compatible problem among the different devices, we use the RESTful api to leverage the data exchange. The presentation layer is used to translation data between network services and applications. The application level is represents the high level-API that provide to the users.

###Demo
Figure2 is the screenshot of the demo. 

* The vote part is used to analyse the which area is more clean. The results will be showed in real time and it will also be rest at the 00:00 every day.
* I just designed a small game in the game part. In this scenario, user drag the varies rubbish into the four different rubbish bin. If the choice right, the rubbish will disappear. That means the rubbish was put into the correct rubbish bin. If wrong, the waste will at the original place wait for the user to do another choice. Based on the suggestions proposed by Phillipa, I will add the score system (punishment) to this kind of games. This will enhance the sense that how to recycle waste correctly.
