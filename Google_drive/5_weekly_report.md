* Have a meeting with the Phillipa and get more information (The formula of the carbon dioxide calculation and the icons of the waste).

##Continuous Delivery Part

* Have a meeting with the Mojtaba and talk about technical part of the continuous delivery pipeline.
* After the investigation of the various technology, I use the Artifactory to achieve the artifact management and use Vagrant to support the provisioning phase.
* Successful linked the Artifactory with the Jenkins. The task will build automatically through the Artifactory on Jenkins. User could access to the build information from the Artifactory server.
	* Jenkins Server: **http://159.203.118.197:8080**
	* Artifactory Server: **http://159.203.118.197:8081**
* I will investigate how to write the configuration file by Vagrant and wrap the whole pipeline run time environment into the virtual machine. Beside of this, I will also investigate the containerisation of the run time environment virtual machine.
