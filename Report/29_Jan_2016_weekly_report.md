#Weekly Report

##What I have done this week

###Game Part
I have finished the design of the game 'Which Bin' and 'Brain Storm'. As mentioned in the last weekly report, the 'Which bin' game helps students to build the connections between the waste and waste bin, and the 'Brain Storm' is aimed to training students more sensitive to the recycling related words. 

In the 'Which Bin' game, the window will be divided into two parts, and students shake their mobile device to choose the right waste bin for the imaged showed in the central. The latter game is designed based on several long sentence, each sentence contains different recycling waste words, and the sentence will only show several seance for one time. The purpose for the students is to find all the related words in these sentences. The difficulty of this game depends on the length of the sentence and the time present to the user.

###CO2 Calculation
I designed a web page based view for calculating the CO2 emission for different types of waste based on the given quantities. After the selection, the system will automatically showed the result on the screen. At the same time, it will compare the result to the CO2 which consumed by the household on the electricity.

###Feedback
In order to get more improvements on the current situation for the waste recycling in the hub central, I put an seperate feedback page. The user just write the suggestion or proposals, and submit to the back-end system. The staff will receive the message of have quick view of it.



##Meeting minutes
I introduced the new features added into the system week, and Phillip gave some suggestions for the current version.

* The colour should be more bright that enables everyone could clear identify the waste bin. It is better to have a colour-blind mode.
* There should be a selection on the feedback page to classify the proposals.
* A pop up window, which contains the reason, should be showed when user select the wrong choice.
* The description in the CO2 calculation page need a adjustment.

Beside from this, Phillip will also provided the content showed in the 'Learning Center' and two games. (Multiple Choice and Brain Storm)


##What I will do next week

* Modify the color in the system.
* Debug the function for each part.
* Improvements on the back-end system.
