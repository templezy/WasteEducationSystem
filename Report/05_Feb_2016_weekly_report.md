# What I have done this week

As a enhancement for the client side, I change the feedback page to a new part called 'More'. I use the list layout to show the several functions that user could manipulated. It contains 'Settings', 'About Us' and 'Feedback'. These pages will help people to customisation their application and also generate the feedback to the developer team.

Based on the game content Phillipa gave to me, I finish all the game part. Beside of this, the 'Learning Centre' and 'CO2 Calculation' two modules also modified based on the suggestions Phillipa proposed.

I move the project server side to the cloud. That means the application could access from the public address and fetching the data. If we published the application to the App store, every one could download and use it. 

Furthermore, I put the project on the Github. I set three branches for documents(master branch), client side(client-side branch) and server side(dev). I will write documents for the development and deployment configuration.  


# Meeting minutes

I showed the improvements on the system. I also asked the Phillipa to give further information that could be put into the system.

* The short and concise introduction of the system features (For the guidance page)
* The content for the 'Learning Centre' and 'CO2 Calculation' part
* Resources for the sound that will be added into the game system
* Provide a application icon and theme (colour combinations) for the whole system


# What I will do next week

* Filling the system based on the content Phillipa gave to me
