#Weekly Report

##What I have done last week

For the last week, I just adjust adjust the layout for the whole content framework. In order to provide some basic knowledge for the game system, I added a part called 'Learning Centre'. This part will be showed through the form of the web page. Most of the content in the 'Learning Centre' will be obtained from the document Phillip gave to me. This part lays emphasis on the introduction of the current situation for the waste management in the hub and also give a brief illustration on the knowledge of the waste recycling. 

Another improvement is in the game system part. I added two more games into it. The first one called 'Which bin', which used for students to choose which waste bin is appropriate for the waste given by the game system. The picture of the waste will be showed on the screen first. At the same time, the whole window will be divided in to two part, each of them represents an waste bin. But only one of the waste bin is the correct answer. Students will shake the mobile device left or right to make their choice. 

The second game called 'Brain Storm'. In this scene, a long sentence will be given at first. Different from the conventional way, the sentence will be given word by word. Students should remember the words, which related to the waste recycling. In the final stage, they will give total count of these words. The difficulty of this game depends on the length of the sentence. So the game designer could adjust the length of the sentence and number of the words to increase the difficulty of this game. 

In order to make the application have more connections with the real life, we add a seperate part, which could calculate the CO2 for varies of waste. Students could choose the different types of waste and the quantities of it. The total CO2 will be showed on the screen. I think this part will be significant to enhance the sense of the waste recycling.


## Meeting minutes

I illustrated some new features I added in to the system. The contents of the two new games will be provided by the Phillip this week. Phillip also gave some suggestions on the 'Learning Centre' part. For the diagrams, we could use some animations to compare the differences between the wrong waste recycling and correct ones. This will more effective than put the single diagram directly on the web page.


##The plan for this week

* Finish the design of two new games
* Build the web page for the learning centre
* Construct the module for the CO2 calculation part
* Modify some details of the application
