#What I have done this week


I just put the questions, which Phillip gave to me, into the application. Besides of this, I just added the several pages to handle the different RESTful request from the client side for fetching the game data. Furthermore, I also design the GUI for the client side application.
 
 * Game Choosing Module

This part is designed by a scroll view, which have two columns. Through this part, user could access to the different part of games. As showed in the screenshot, we now have two games in it. If more needed, we will add them into the system during the next several weeks.

* Optional Question

This part is designed for user to play the optional question games. User could choose different option and get a score at last. The real-time score will be showed on the top left of screen.

* True or False Game

This part is designed for increasing resolving ability in the waste education. The system will give out varies descriptions on the screen. When have a quick view of it, users will decide correctness of this description. Same as the previous game, it also contained a scoring system.

* Game Control

This part is designed as a individual reusable module that could be embedded into each game. There will be a pause button on the top-left for each game view. When user click it, the control menu will pop up. As can be seen from the screenshot beloved, the resume button will bring user return to the game scene. The restart button will start the game again(remove the current score and replaced by a new set of quiz questions). The last button will bring user to the game choosing view.
